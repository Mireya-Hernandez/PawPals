# PawPals
This project, an application developed using IntelliJ written in Java programming language. The intent of this application is to develop an app called Paw Pals, which is an app that allows users with pets to connect to other users with pets. Though for now it simply indicates the matches available base on traits to determine the type of animal a pet is and the type of food they would enjoy. 
# Project: Implementing Design Patterns in Source Code
Software description: In my application, I utilize the strategy design pattern, decorator design pattern, and observer design pattern.  The program was developed by Mireya Hernandez for an indiviual class project, Design Pattern & Refactoring, in college.
